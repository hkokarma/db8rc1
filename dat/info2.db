a+thin+red+line This movie quite frankly, sucked ass. Go watch Saving Private Ryan, because this one was disjoined, plot non existant, and there was ZERO character development. It tried to be dramatic like Forest Gump, but ended up being the next SMURFS with guns. Not only that, but it lasted what felt like 5 hours.

double+jeopardy This movie had a cool idea -- get convicted of a murder, then when it turns out the guy you killed framed you, you get to kill them and double jeopardy prevents you from being tried again. The problem: The movies premise was not used in the movie, and when it was mentioned, was corney. Overall an okay flick, but don't expect THAT much from it.

ircd-hybrid ircd-hybrid is the ircd mainly used on EfNet. It can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.vol.com/pub/ircd/
ircd2.3 ircd Version 2.3 was unfortunate mistake containing copyright violations. so it was soon taken off distribution.
ircd2.4 Version 2.4 contains *very* many bug fixes, enhancements, and "hooks" for use in future releases. The source tree has been restructured, and the Makefiles rewritten to be recursive and follow the new source tree layout
ircd2.5 Version 2.5 contains string channels and channel modes (as well as channel operators). Also Wizible's MAIL system was included as an option.
ircd2.7 New in ircd v2.7: user modes i,w,s,o implemented, oper passwds can be crypted, ircd creates a .pid file, the /join/part commands accepts more than one parm, ie; join #chan1,#chan2
ircd2.7.1 New in ircd v2.7.1: user modes u,r,z.
ircd2.8 ircd2.8 had patches to do the following: Tp8 = TimeStampPre8 - A protocol which disallows netsplit ops and desyncs. Bquiet - does not allow a person who is banned to speak over the channel. Silence - Cuts off flooding at local server. Anc = Anti-Nick collide. W = Wallops. S = Signon Time. KL = K-line comments - Allows you to modify the lame "no ghosts allowed" defaut. OF = Oper fail patch.

keyword Keywords are channel passwords which allow only those who know the keyword to join the channel. If you know a channel's keyword, type /join #channel keyword  If you do not know the keyword, type /who #channel and ask a channel operator.  Since setting a secret keyword is a common way of taking over a channel, ask: bot, takeover for more help.

maple According to Snooker, "Maple" and "Mathematica" are two very popular mathematics programs.  They're essentially specialized mathematical "packages", though some might consider them basic "compilers". ..I've used primarily "Maple" in my differential equations and linear algebra classes, but both are available on Windows 95/NT platforms. :)

meet+joe+black This two tape 3 hour movie was hardly worth the time, unless you are a die-hard fan of Brad Pitt. The ending had a nice twist, but technical things from a by-stander's perspective don't fit, such as "doesn't it look like the guy killed her dad?" and "gee, what a happy ending, shes in love with a multi-personality freak" come to mind. 1/5 stars.

mp3 MP3 stands for MPEG 1 layer 3, which is a way to store music files on a computer disk in such a way that the file size is relatively small, but the song sounds near perfect. You can indentify mp3 files because they will end in .mp3..   Try out http://www.mp3.com/dummies.html for info on mp3's. (for more info ask bot about MP34)
mp34 MPEG Layer 3 is a efficient coding technique that produce a great data reduction on audio data.  With a 44100Hz frequency coding, the original sound data from a audio CD is skrink down by a factor 12 without losing sound quality. Factors of 24 and even more still maintain a sound quality that is significantly better than what you get by just reducing the sampling rate and the resolution

net.burst Net.Burst is when a server links to the network, and all the servers have to sync up, so all the channels, all the users, all the user modes, bans etc, have to be sent to the new server so they are all in sync. This typically takes no more than 5 mins (the initial lag when a server reconnects to the network)
net/free/open/bsd[i] OpenBSD is secure, NetBSD is portable, and FreeBSD is fast. I'm not sure where exactly BSDI fits in; probably more fast and secure than portable. (OpenBSD is actually fairly comparable to NetBSD in portability, and of the four systems, they're probably the closest, having split least recently.)

pentium+pro The Pentium Pro is around now for several years and still it never made it to a best seller as its siblings Pentium, Pentium w/MMX and Pentium II. The main reason for that is and was its weakness with 16 bit code, such as Windows 3.x or Windows 95. The Pentium Pro used to be a clear winner under Windows NT though and there are still a few advantages over the Pentium II in a high end environment.
pentiumbug To test if your pentium has the bug, 1048958.75 / 2.9999991 and see if the number ends with a 2 or a 3, if it ends with a 2 (ie; 349632.x) then it has the pentium bug

ppro The Pentium Pro is Intel's sixth generation microprocessor (P6). Although, it shares the same name as the fifth-generation Pentium microprocessor, the Pentium Pro is architecturally quite different. Thanks to modern design techniques, including superpipelining, dynamic execution, and on-chip L2 cache, the Pentium Pro can perform at nearly twice the speed of previous Pentium microprocessors.

practical+magic This movie sucked. Not much else to say. It was boring, there wasn't much "magic" to speak of, the plot was slow, the acting was bad, there wasn't any nudity. While this movie was tailored for teen-aged girls, I'm sure even 98% of them would also agree with me, this movie is lame.

program :program: n. 1. A magic spell cast over a computer allowing it to turn one's input into error messages.  2. An exercise in experimental epistemology.  3. A form of art, ostensibly intended for the instruction of computers, which is nevertheless almost inevitably a failure if other programmers can't understand it.
programing :programming: n. 1. The art of debugging a blank sheet of paper. 2. n. A pastime similar to banging one's head against a wall, but with fewer opportunities for reward. 3. n. The most fun you can have with your clothes on (although clothes are not mandatory).

ravenous This movie can be described in one word, "Gay"  the plot centers around an ancient indian legend that 'once a man eats the flesh of another man, he'll want more', and so the plot thickens. People eat each other, and become almost immortals, but theres no real special effects for it, just some blood and a lot of fights at the end of the movie.

ronin This movie is the type of movie you go to watch when you are tired of all the good guy/bad guy flicks that never hurt the innocent bystanders. They get dirty and have no probs with killing people who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The only problem I had with this was it was ONE mission, much like Mission impossible, I like to see several missions and not one shot deals.
root I heard root is the default SuperUser login account name for unix boxen. The Superuser has permissions to read/modify any files for any user. Misuse of this login can really mess up a unix box (Otool knows all about this ;)

running A man was running. He ran from the melted cow. The common pasture was very large and as fast as he could run he still couldn't outrun the common pasture. The cow was melted so time didn't really matter at all. Time became irrelevant and the man decided that time was of no use because the more he ran the same distance he was from the common pasture...

star+trek+insurrection This movie was nicely made, however any REAL star trek fan will be dissipointed. Reason? The movie takes place on a known planet, there is no exploring, and hardly any parts of the movie takes place on the Enterprise... actually, hardly anything takes place in space.
star+wars+episode+1 The movie started out poorly, acting was bad, and script written for a 6 yo audience, however the second half of the movie was great. The big bad boss wasn't that big or bad, and the pod race and battle between the jedi and Darth Maul was the two best parts of the movie. the rest of this 2 hr flick was "alright", I hope the second and third episodes can live up to the hype.

takeinfo A Takeover is only considered a 'takeover' if the user(s) gained ops via an abuse of network resources, such as via netsplits. Also, ICMPing or 'nuking' is also a valid reason, being a denial of service attack.
takeinfo2 If a user(s) were given ops and then de-opped you, this is NOT a takeover. They were given ops legimately, and had every right to de-op, or set modes as they pleased. We cannot help in these situations. Also if the taker joined an empty channel, this is not considered a takeover.
takeover  Unregistered channels are 'owned' by the person who first joins, and anyone he/she ops.  If an op kick bans and locks you out by setting modes such as +i or +k, it is a 'legitimate' takeover. If the channel is taken by splitriders or someone nukes you offline, an IRC op will return it if you show logs. Registered channels are protected by the network.

the+13th+floor It was not quite what it said it would be. Most of it instead of being hitec, was low tech, placed in the 1930's. The only twist in the plot was the fact that the guys who develop the simulation of a world with real people, finds out his own world is just a simulation also. If you just read this topic, going to see the movie now would pretty much be a waste of time. Shame too, I give it 3/5 stars.
the+avengers This movie may had a chick in a tight rubber outfit, but the problem is, THAT DIDN'T LAST! The show's plot was the most god-aweful lame crap i've ever seen. The jokes were all British, so they were about as funny as a jewish guy telling a joke upside down, set on fire, in spanish. If you want to blow your cash on something, just set your money on fire, you'll be better off.
the+big+hit The movie was slow paced, it did not offer anything -- unless your a 16 year old teenaged girl who likes marky-mark. 
the+blair+witch+project What starts off as a copycat of "the real world" gets serious after about half an hour. The plot is basically: boring as hell, boring as hell, starts to get exciting, you wonder wtf is going on, then everyone is dead. So... what else is there to say?
the+dialectizer http://www.rinkworks.com/dialect/
the+faculty This movie had great special effects, and keeps you on your toes most of the show, wondering whats going on, and who the queen alien really is. Natrally it's "they" are out to get us, but maybe its one of US, type situation. If you expect a great storyline that is intelectually stimulating, don't bother with this one, it's been done before-- but this version was very well done, and had almost part
the+matrix This movie is THE BOMB. It doesnt use a few computer terms to boost it's ratings (The Net), and has one of the best plots around (kicks the crap out of the X-Files movie), the graphics are top notch. The tale while at first sounds like everyone is speaking in riddles, is actually explaining in clear english, you'd need to watch this movie 2x to fully understand. Coming soon, the matrix II and III!
the+mummy While my brother contends this show is better than The Matrix, I strongly disagree. The Mummy was okay -- it's plot is exactly what you'd imagine just by the cannotations from it's name. No real twists in the plot, linear and straightforward. 3/5 stars.
the+negotiator GREAT MOVIE, likely the best for 1998. Capturing plot, intelligent storyline, twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat. This is a definate don't miss.
the+opposite+of+sex This movie did it's own thing. It had a lot of great jokes and witty lines till the middle of the show, after that point it kinda dragged on, but don't take that wrong, the movie is still well worth watching, the ending was intresting too. It gets 4/5 stars.
the+postman this is Waterworld w/o any water, action, and good ol kevin dont even have ne gills this time. lame-o flick.
the+siege This movie is too much over-rated in the commercials. The movie spanned what seemed like forever. The pace was slow, and the plot none too exciting. Take a look if you don't mind blowing your cash for a seat to sleep in.
the+truth -PRIVMSG C~ :You can't handle the truth!
the+waterboy This movie had a few funny moments, unfortunately, you've already seen them all during the commercials for the show. Save your money and get a haircut instead.

wild+things If you rented this movie, you prolly just wanted to see young women naked. Well you'll get some of that, but unlike Strip Tease, you also get a pretty good plot that twists around on you several times. I'd give it 4 stars.
wild+wild+west This movie is another in the recent trend of movies aimed towards the 13 year olds, it's plot was straight forward, very linear without any twists in the plot, but the movie was still able to be very funny and enjoyable to watch. Don't expect it to be a major blockbuster like MiB, but it's fun for what it was designed for. 4/5 stars

write_a_bot The best way for a beginner to write a bot is to use the scripting language of their client, such as mIRC, pIRCH, ircle, or ircII. More advanced scripters usually use Perl, C, Tcl, etc. To learn how to script in your own client, ask in a bot channel, look on a bot website, or consult your clients documentation.
