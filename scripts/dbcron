# Darkbot's crontab utility

DBPATH="/home/hko/darkbot" # your darkbot directory
DBBIN="darkbot"   # Darkbot's binary (executable) file
DBPIDFILE="darkbot.pid" # process ID file (same as binary + .pid)

# This file was automatically generated the first time you've run  dbcron.
# If for any reason you've changed your  Darkbot directory or it's  binary
# you'll need to modify the variables DBPATH DBBIN and DBPIDFILE on top of
# this file accordingly to the actual values.
# Defaulty crontab job is of 10 mins interval. If you wish to change it
# edit '0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *'. If you don't understand it type 'man crontab'
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What this script does:
# Changes to darkbot root dir; if pid file exists extracts pid number;
# tests it by issuing an inoffensive kill; if pid is active exits, doing
# nothing; if not means the file with pid is there but there is no active
# process, so removes it. finally cheks if program bin exists then starts it.
# ____________ Do not change anything bellow this line! ____________#
